# Contributing to Living Signal™

Thank you for your interest in the Living Signal™ methodology.

This repository holds the official documentation for the **Living Signal protocol**. Our primary goal is to maintain a stable, verified standard that individuals can trust for their long-term data preservation.

Because this is a **standard**, we manage contributions differently than a typical software project. Stability and intentionality are prioritized over rapid iteration.

## Governing Philosophy

1.  **Stability**: The syntax (e.g., `// [Timestamp]`) is designed to be parsed decades from now. Breaking changes are generally discouraged.
2.  **Authority**: To protect the integrity of the method, final decisions on the protocol specification rest with the maintainer (Aaron Sahlstrom).
3.  **Scope**: This repository defines the *data protocol* and *human method*. It does typically not include specific AI implementation code, scripts, or apps, which belong in separate repositories.

## What We Welcome

*   **Clarifications**: Improvements to the readability of `journaling-method.md` or `cheat-sheet.md`.
*   **Typos & Errors**: Fixes for objective errors in the text.
*   **Discussion**: Questions about applying the method (best handled in GitHub Discussions).

## How to Submit Changes

1.  **Search**: Check existing Issues to see if your idea has already been discussed.
2.  **Fork**: Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
3.  **Branch**: Create a branch for your specific change.
4.  **Pull Request**: Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch.
    *   Please explain *why* this change is necessary.
    *   For protocol changes, explain how it affects backward compatibility with existing journals.
