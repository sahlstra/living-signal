# Living Signal

A human-first journaling methodology designed to preserve lived experience, meaning, and persona continuity across time.

## Overview

Living Signal is a framework for capturing personal history in a way that is natural for humans to write and structurally legible for future retrieval systems (including AI). It focuses on "signaling" moments of high meaning—Reflection, Emotion, Decision, Identity—without turning journaling into a data-entry task.

## Documentation

- **[Journaling Method](docs/journaling-method.md)**: The core guide. How to write, structure entries, and use signal blocks.
- **[Cheat Sheet](docs/cheat-sheet.md)**: A quick reference for entry format and signal types.
- **[Persona Guidance](docs/persona-guidance.md)**: Instructions for using this journal corpus to prompt or align an AI persona (e.g., for RAG systems).
- **[Whitepaper](docs/whitepaper.md)**: The theoretical and academic background behind the methodology.
