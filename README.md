# Living Signal

A human-first journaling method designed to preserve lived experience, meaning, and persona continuity across time, digitization, and AI processing.

## Overview

Living Signal is a journaling method for capturing personal history in a way that is natural for humans to write and structurally legible for future retrieval systems (including AI). It focuses on "signaling" moments of high meaning—Reflection, Emotion, Decision, Identity—without turning journaling into a data-entry task.

## Documentation

- **[Journaling Method](docs/journaling-method.md)**: The core guide. How to write, structure entries, and use signal blocks.
- **[Cheat Sheet](docs/cheat-sheet.md)**: A quick reference for entry format and signal types.
- **[Whitepaper](docs/whitepaper.md)**: The theoretical and academic background behind the methodology.

## Scope & Intent

This repository focuses exclusively on the **journaling method** and the underlying **data protocol** for writing. It does not prescribe a specific AI implementation or prompting strategy.

By separating the method from the model, Living Signal serves as a neutral foundation for any future digitization system. The structured "signals" provided by this method can be used to power:

- **RAG-based AI Personas:** Retrieving signals to ground chatbot responses in authentic lived experience.
- **Personal Analytics:** Visualizing trends in emotion or decision-making over time.
- **Digital Biographies:** Structurally organizing memories for narrative generation.
- **Mental Health Tools:** Tracking patterns in reflection and identity.

The data remains your own, structured for whatever future intelligence you choose to apply to it.
