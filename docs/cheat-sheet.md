# Living Signal - Inside Cover Cheat Sheet

Author: Aaron Sahlstrom

## Entry Format

```
DATE:
LOCATION:
CONTEXT: <one word>

Then write normally.

Add a Signal only if something matters:

```
-
Signal: <Type>
<your words>
-
```

That is the entire structure.

- Decision - choice, commitment, intent
- Question - open inquiry, uncertainty
- Memory - past resurfacing with meaning
- Identity - who I am / who I am becoming

## Rules

- Signals are optional and intentional
- Write like a human

## Context Examples
